    <p><em>Joseph - General Manager, <strong>Author & Consultant</strong></em></p>
  </h3>
  <p><strong>Introduction and Career Aspirations:</strong>
    I am a proven business leader seeking a senior level position in operations with a growing diverse company. My key strength is in Operational Excellence & Cultural Transformations originating from the operations floor to the executive level.
    I
    have over 25 years of leadership and kaizen experience. I have led organizations ranging from 80 to 800 (employees) and $13M to $220M in revenue. My core belief is that ‘Processes create results, people work on processes, therefore results
    start
    with people.’ I utilize a set roadmap for achieving results based upon leadership, teamwork & problem solving through data analytics.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Professional Certifications & Education:</strong>

    • Author of ‘Business Performance System’ & ‘The 9Q’s of Leadership’
    • Emerson Executive Leadership Development Program

    • Six Sigma Greenbelt, Quality Management Association
    • Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, University of Mississippi
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Leadership:</strong>
    I have led organizations to high performance by investing in the team members. Also, I have trained over 2000+ in kaizen methodologies and leadership concepts at 8 or more organizations. In addition to developing and implementing company
    management operating systems designed to achieve (R2) results at multiple organizations. My team and I submitted for and won awards for our plant’s cultural transformation. I was the designated Employee Engagement Officer for the Union City
    plant at Goodyear. In that role I developed the engagement method and trained the plant leadership team. Stephen Covey’s Seven 7 Habits of highly effective people has been a fundamental training resource. Increased plant & interplant
    communications via daily manufacturing support team meetings. Established cost reduction systems for goals achievement. I established plant SIOP process covering bookings to work cell utilization.
  </p>
  <p>I established key performance indicators such as: {Safety: [‘Total Incident Rate’, ‘Recordables’, ‘First Aids’, ‘# Observations’], Quality: [‘DPU’, ‘PPM’, ‘Yield’, ‘Scrap as % of sales’], Productivity: [‘OEE’, ‘100% Theoretical’, ‘Output per
    hour’, ‘Meantime between failure’], Delivery: [‘OTD%’, ‘Schedule Attainment’] , Cost: [‘Gross Margin’, ‘Labor cost per unit’, ‘Material cost per unit’, ‘Earned hours vs target’, ‘Capital Expenditures’], SIOP: [ ‘Bookings’, ‘Inventory $’,
    ’Inventory turns’] , Morale: [‘Absenteeism’, ‘Turnover’, ‘#Employee Suggestions’, ‘Employee Survey Results]}.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Data Analytics:</strong>
    I led teams to setup the enhanced data analytics focus for several organizations; using Microsoft Office, Python & Power BI. This system’s approach allowed the teams to translate data into information thereby immediately exposing the
    condition
    of the process for further analysis and improvement. Transitioned leadership meetings to be more data driven. KPI’s translated to daily /weekly cadence versus monthly via team empowerment efforts and the use of Microsoft Power BI.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Kaizen:</strong>
    I have led organizations toward improving operations via lean manufacturing and six sigma. I utilized kaizen as a tool to build something greater. I ensured that leaders were trained in continuous improvement and then relentlessly improved
    the
    processes to have them to become predictable and repeatable. We utilized appropriate continuous improvement tools necessary to achieve our targets. The application of kaizen has produced many results over the years. A few key examples of the
    results are the following:
