    <strong>Leadership:</strong>
    I have worked as a leadership professional helping both small and large businesses to improve the process to reach higher levels of productivity. As a leader in the supply chain industry, I have worked in purchasing, materials as well as
    operations. I am motivated most by finding ways to invest in my teams and peers to make our workplace better ensuring that we leave it better for the generation to follow. I daily supported my teams efforts as we were working on cost reductions
    through the use of basic kaizen and common sense. I appreciate the teams that I have worked with throughout the years.

    My time outside of the business world has centered around giving back to those around me. My husband and I have worked in local churches giving back from an instructional perspective. We have written more than 5 books to help local churches to do
    more for Christ. I am proud to be a partner in that endeavor. We also produced books to help the Christian business professional. You can see more on that in my Portfolio link listed at the end of my resume.

    <strong>Data Analytics:</strong>
    I am passionate regarding the use of data. Having worked at GE Gas Turbines and being indoctrinated into the Six Sigma process, speaking with data was the expectation. I recently enrolled in Udemy to learn more about Power BI and visualization
    dashboards.
  <p><strong>Kaizen:</strong>
    My cost reduction efforts are a primary reflection of my ability to reduce waste from operations. I started utilizing the concept of e-auctions at GE. I also have been the primary leader for plant material cost downs. I am not only a purchasing
    agent, but I also have a background in operations, so I understand shopfloor improvements. I look forward to speaking more with you regarding my background.
